This was just an A section to a piece but I've got the whole thing down on one guitar.

Took me a lot of careful writing to make the bassline and melody work in tandem and then practice to actually hit it.

Also 6 triplet notes in a row in the melody on nylon string felt like a great way to utilize it's sound and unique character.

##Production
Three tracks - one of the full piece on one guitar, then, EQ'd for compatibility: one track of the melody line and one track of the bass line.

##Music
It's written in EADG(Bb)(D) tuning so I could roll the same note on two different strings and have them ring out together. Different textures (nylon vs steel) on the same note and same acoustic body create a sort of magic air

##Lyrics
none!
